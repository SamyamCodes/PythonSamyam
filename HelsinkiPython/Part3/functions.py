'''
Important: on this course the automatic tests that are run on the exercise files 
require an empty main function. No commands should be left in the main function of 
your solution. That is, any code that you yourself use for testing must be contained 
in a specially defined if block:

def greet():
    print("Hi!")

# Write your main function within a block like this:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet()
'''

# Write your solution here
# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#   seven_brothers()
def seven_brothers():
    print("Aapo")
    print("Eero")
    print("Juhani")
    print("Lauri")
    print("Simeoni")
    print("Timo")
    print("Tuomas")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    seven_brothers()
