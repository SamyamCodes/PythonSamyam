'''
Please write a program which asks the user to input a string. 
The program then prints out different messages if the string contains 
any of the vowels a, e or o.

You may assume the input will be in lowercase entirely. 
Have a look at the examples below.

Sample output
Please type in a string: hello there
a not found
e found
