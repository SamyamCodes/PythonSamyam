Sorting lists
The items in a list can be sorted from smallest to greatest with the method sort.

my_list = [2,5,1,2,4]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)
Sample output
[1, 2, 2, 4, 5]

Notice how the method modifies the list itself. Sometimes we don't want to change the original list, so we use the function sorted instead. It returns a sorted list:

my_list = [2,5,1,2,4]
print(sorted(my_list))
Sample output
[1, 2, 2, 4, 5]

Remember the difference between the two: sort changes the order of the original list in place, whereas sorted creates a new, ordered copy of the list. With sorted we can preserve the original order of the list:

original = [2, 5, 1, 2, 4]
in_order = sorted(original)
print(original)
print(in_order)
Sample output
[2, 5, 1, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 2, 4, 5]
