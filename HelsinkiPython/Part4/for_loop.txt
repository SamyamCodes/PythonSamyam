The for loop
When you want to go through some ready collection of items, the Python for loop will do this for you. 
For instance, the loop can go through all items in a list from first to last.

When using a while loop the program doesn't "know" beforehand how many iterations the loop will perform. 
It will repeat until the condition becomes false, or the loop is otherwise broken out of. 
That is why it falls under indefinite iteration. With a for loop the number of iterations is determined when the loop is set up, 
and so it falls under definite iteration.

The idea is that the for loop takes the items in the collection one by one and performs the same actions on each. 
The programmer does not have to worry about which item is being handled when. The syntax of the for loop is as follows:

for <variable> in <collection>:
    <block>
The for loop takes an item in the collection, assigns it to the variable, 
processes the block of code, and moves on to the next item. When all items in the collection have been processed, 
execution of the program continues from the line after the loop.

The following program prints out all the items in a list using a for loop:

my_list = [3, 2, 4, 5, 2]

for item in my_list:
    print(item)
Sample output
3
2
4
5
2


Compared to the example at the beginning of this section, the structure is much easier to understand. 
A for loop makes straightforward traversal through a collection of items very simple.

The same principle applies to characters in a string:

name = input("Please type in your name: ")

for character in name:
    print(character)
Sample output
Please type in your name: Grace
G
r
a
c
e


The function range
Often you know how many times you want to repeat a certain bit of code. 
You might, for example, wish to go through all the numbers between 1 and 100. 
The range function plugged into a for loop will do this for you.

There are a few different ways to call the range function. 
The simplest way is to give the function just one argument, which signifies the end-point of the range. 
The end-point itself is excluded, just like with string slices. 
In other words, the function call range(n) provides a loop with a range from 0 to n-1:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
Sample output
0
1
2
3
4

With two arguments, the function will return a range between the two numbers. 
The function range(a,b) provides a range starting from a and ending at b-1:

for i in range(3, 7):
    print(i)
Sample output
3
4
5
6

Finally, with a third argument you can also specify the size of the step the range takes between each value. 
The function call range(a, b, c) provides a range starting from a, ending at b-1, and changing by c with every step:

for i in range(1, 9, 2):
    print(i)
Sample output
1
3
5
7

A step can also be negative. Then the range will be in reversed orded. 
Notice the first two arguments are also flipped here:

for i in range(6, 2, -1):
    print(i)
Sample output
6
5
4
3
