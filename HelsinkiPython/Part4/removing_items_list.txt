Removing items from a list
There are two different approaches to removing an item from a list:

If the index of the item is known, you can use the method pop.
If the contents of the item are known, you can use the method remove.
So, the method pop takes the index of the item you want to remove as its argument. 
The following program removes items at indexes 2 and 3 from the list. 
Notice how the indexes of the remaining items change when one is removed.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

my_list.pop(2)
print(my_list)
my_list.pop(3)
print(my_list)
Sample output
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 4, 6]

It's useful to remember that the method pop also returns the removed item:

my_list = [4, 2, 7, 2, 5]

number = my_list.pop(2)
print(number)
print(my_list)
Sample output
7
[4, 2, 2, 5]

The method remove, on the other hand, takes the value of the item to be removed as 
its argument. For example, this program

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list)
my_list.remove(5)
print(my_list)
prints out this:

Sample output
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 3, 4, 6]

The method removes the first occurrence of the value in the list, much like the 
string function find returns the first occurrence of a substring:

my_list = [1, 2, 1, 2]

my_list.remove(1)
print(my_list)
my_list.remove(1)
print(my_list)
Sample output
[2, 1, 2]
[2, 2]
